# Homework 7
This is homework #7 for KIEI-451. Using a starting movie page and watched status tracker, the assignment is to 
- Implement login flow, including account creation
- Track user data in a database collection separate from authentication
- Show user-specific information and a logout button when a user is logged in
- Implement user-specific watchlists

In addition to the required rubric, the following features are included for usability
- Movie posters and watched buttons are hidden until all are loaded
- The page shows a loading message with progress cues until all database pulls are complete
- The user can click a watched movie to set it to unwatched.
- Other minor UI enhancements

The page uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication and data storage.
